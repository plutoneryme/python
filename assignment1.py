#Assignment
#1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters = (weight)/(height squared)
# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
#search and come up with an example of a complex data type


weight = 78
height = 1.75
BMI = (weight)/(height**2)
print ("This is the BMI: ", BMI)


# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
length = 48
width = 25
area = length * width
print("This is the area: ", area)

perimeter=(2*length)+(2*width)
print("This is the perimeter: ", perimeter)
